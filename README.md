The artists from this exhibit each had an individual piece that they worked on to create the gallery as a whole, which contained wearable pieces, mixed media art with sculptures and electronics, all created by femme artists. We also helped each other when and where it was possible. My personal piece involved the Microsoft Kinect's skeletal tracking feature to interact simply with this piece, Particle Flow, which was projected against a wall. 

I used Java in Processing's IDE to create this code. The size of the particles is directly linked to the noise from the microphone that is connected. The movement of the particles is based upon the Perlin Noise flow field.
